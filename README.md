# SvelteKit + Node Adapter + Sentry Errors

This repo demonstrates a failure with SvelteKit, Sentry, and the `adapter-node` build target.

While the Sentry Wizard will install `@sentry/sveltekit` to `dependencies`, we want our build to be completely hermetic and have attempted to install it to `devDependencies`. This does not seem to be supported, as we get the following error: 

```
error during build:
